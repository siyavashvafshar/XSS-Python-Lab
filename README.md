# XSS Python

simple Flask app that contains an example of multiple Injection (XSS) vulnerabilities and its main goal is to describe how a malicious user could exploit them on this purposefully vulnerable app.

## What is Cross-Site Scripting?

XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victimâ€™s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.
